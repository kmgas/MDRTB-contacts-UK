## MDRTB-contacts-UK

This is a resource for the MDR TB contacts registry UK study

It includes all the training documents and resources you will need to set up a study site

It is an open access site for all interested UK MDR TB services to access the training resources and decide whether to participate

The MDR TB contacts registry can be found here https://mdrtb-contacts.lshtm.ac.uk/

You will be able to access this once your site is live and you've received the 10 minute training session

Please watch the welcome video before accessing the documents, you can find this here (https://bit.ly/3kR55ep)

Many thanks for your interest and we look forward to working with you
