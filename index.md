## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

This is a resource for the MDRTB contacts registry UK study

It includes all the information you will need to set up a study site

It is open access for all interested UK MDR TB services to view the training resources and decide whether to participate

The MDRTB contacts registry can be accessed once your site is live and you've received the 10 minute training session

Many thanks for your interest and we look forward to working with you

Dave Moore & Kate Gaskell

To join the study you will need the following

1. Local ethical approval
  * To do this you need to complete:
    * The organisation information document_V1 [OID](/HRA_approval_documents/MDRTBcontactsregistry_Organisation_Information_Document.docx) IRAS form. You can find this in the folder named HRA approval documents for each site.
   	 	
   	   	* 	To complete this you need signatures from:
      	* 	A local PI (a lead TB clinician on site)
       	* 	A local point of contact for the LSHTM sponsor. If the NHS site has a Research and Development Office (R&D), Contract Research Organisation (CRO) or Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) it should be a contact at the R&D/CRO/CTU. If these do not exist this can be a study sponsor, study manager, study coordinator or clinical research scientist.
    
    * Amend the OID to reference your site only
    * Amend the [IRAS schedule of events](/HRA_approval_documents/IRAS_scheduleofevents.xls) to ensure it is site specific. You can find this in the folder named HRA approval documents for each site.
    * Complete a delegation log [Delegation Log](/HRA_approval_documents/MDRTB_CONTACTS_REGISTRY_DELEGATION_LOG.docx) (after training has been completed)
    * Submit all these forms to your local R&D and make sure you copy us in at david.moore@lshtm.ac.uk and kate.gaskell@lshtm.ac.uk
    
2. Ensure you have up to date Good Clinical Practice training. There are a few online refresher training courses, of which you can access one [here](https://globalhealthtrainingcentre.tghn.org/elearning/).

3. Once you have submitted these forms to your R&D and accessed the training documents, we will arrange training to access the contact registry at https://mdrtb-contacts.lshtm.ac.uk/
