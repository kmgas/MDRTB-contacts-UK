To join the study you will need the following

1. Local ethical approval
  * To do this you need to complete:  
  
	The [organisation information document_V1 OID](/HRA_approval_documents/MDRTBcontactsregistry_Organisation_Information_Document.docx) IRAS form. You can find this in the folder named HRA approval documents for each site.  
   
   To complete this you need signatures from:  
   * A local PI (a lead TB clinician on site)  
   * A local point of contact for the LSHTM sponsor  

If the NHS site has a Research and Development Office (R&D), Contract Research Organisation (CRO) or Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) it should be a contact at the R&D/CRO/CTU.  
If these do not exist this can be a study sponsor, study manager, study coordinator or clinical research scientist.
    
   *  Amend the OID to reference your site only
   *  Amend the [IRAS schedule of events](/HRA_approval_documents/IRAS_scheduleofevents.xls) to ensure it is site specific.  
   *  Complete a delegation log [Delegation Log](/HRA_approval_documents/MDRTB_CONTACTS_REGISTRY_DELEGATION_LOG.docx) (after training has been completed)  

Submit all these forms to your local R&D and make sure you copy us in at david.moore@lshtm.ac.uk and kate.gaskell@lshtm.ac.uk
    
2. Ensure you have up to date Good Clinical Practice training. There are a few online refresher training courses, of which you can access one [here](https://globalhealthtrainingcentre.tghn.org/elearning/).

3. Once you have submitted these forms to your R&D and accessed the training documents, we will arrange training to access the contact registry at https://mdrtb-contacts.lshtm.ac.uk/

<br/><br/>  

Enter your username, password and select ‘login using two-factor authentication’.  

<br/><br/>  

- You will need the authenticator application on your phone to provide the two-factor authentication.  

- Use your mobile NHS authenticator to generate a login code.  

- If you do not have this installed on your phone download it for free via the iPhone App store or Google Play store. 

- If you are not used to using this, please contact us and we will explain during your training session.  

Sign in  

Once connected, the dashboard will be visible:  
  
<br/><br/>   

<img style="float: right;" src="img/dashboard_1.jpeg">  

<br/><br/>  

To log out, click on the profile tab (with your initials) at the top right of the screen.  
  
This dashboard displays real-time, aggregated, anonymised data that has been entered. 
Currently there are two dashboards. 
One for the index patients and one for the contacts. 
You can move between them by selecting the tabs at the top. 
We can add and change them according to our needs. 
Each user can select what to see on their dashboard and there are a range of graphs available.
  
<br/><br/>  

To the left of the profile tab there is a search function called "search applications" highlighted here:  
<br/><br/>  
<img style="float: right;" src="img/dashboard_2.jpeg">  

<br/><br/>  

Select “search applications” and a drop-down menu with applications will appear. 
  
Select the tracker capture that looks like a notepad and pencil, this opens the data entry window.  
  
<br/><br/>  
  
The "tracker capture application" will appear on your screen:

<br/><br/>  
<img style="float: right;" src="img/tracker_capture.jpeg">     
<br/><br/>  

On the left hand side of the thumbnail section the "organisation" hierarchy will be displayed.  

This is the list of countries, regions, districts and sub-districts within the application.    
  
You should see All countries: England, Wales, Scotland. Select your country and a drop-down menu of counties appears, please choose the local authority in which your index patient lives by following the correct region, county, local area.    
  
Once you are in the correct district, the format of the screen changes and you can see two options to choose from in the Lists tab, either TB case surveillance or Contact tracing program.

### Registering participants

Order of steps to follow when first registering participants  
  
1.	When registering an index patient and their contacts for the first time, always start with the index.  
2.	Complete all baseline questions for the index patient before registering the contacts for that index patient.   
3.	Once you have registered both the index and their contact, you can form a relationship link between the two on the system (described later).  

 
<img style="float: right;" src="img/registering_participants.jpeg">    

<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  

To first register their index patient with MDR TB, choose the TB case surveillance option.   

Then click on register to enrol a participant.  
  
The following form, called "registration", will open. Please complete all sections for the MDR TB index patient. Two answers are automatically filled in for you. The enrolment district and the patient ID. The patient ID is the participant's study number. 

You will get the participant study number for each index and contact case once you have registered them in the DHIS2 application.   

The participant study number generated will be unique to each participant and is generated using the date, clinic location, and a unique number for each index participant. Please note that the index study number and their contacts’ study numbers will not be numerically linked - linkage will be explained in this document.   
  
The index patient section has been developed in line with the current WHO DHIS2 TB case surveillance platform.  


<img style="float: centre;" src="img/tb_case_surv.jpeg">  

<br/><br/>  

    The TB clinic name is the name of the treating health centre.
  
    The NTBS number is the unique number given to the TB patient by the TB programme.
    
    Do not leave any answers blank. If you do, you will not be able to proceed to the next step.  
     

If the index patient’s details are similar to another previously entered case, a blue box will appear warning you about a possible duplication. Please enter all patient details and then check if the possible duplicate is an exact match by clicking on "view candidate".  
<br/><br/>  

<img style="float: centre;" src="img/tb_case_surv2.jpeg">   

<br/><br/>  

    There should be no duplicate MDRTB index patients   
    If there is an exact match, please recheck the patient details 
    If a patient experiences a 2nd episode of MDRTB this can be recorded as another episode under the same patient  

<br/><br/>  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/tb_case_surv3.jpeg">  


Once you have completed the registration form correctly for the MDR TB index patient, choose confirm and continue.   

Once you have entered all personal data, confirm it is correct then select confirm and continue.  

<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>   
<br/><br/>  

When the confirmation button is pressed, the following MDRTB index patient home screen will appear:  

<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/tb_index_home.jpeg">   

On the home screen you will see:   
  
  
* the programme the patient is enrolled in   
* their profile   
* their relationships with other participants  
* the indicators their data will populate for display on dashboards   
* their data entry forms in a timeline  

<br/><br/>  

### Index case data   

For initial registration there are four forms to complete for each index:  

1.	Baseline data  
2.	Treatment  
3.	Laboratory results  
4.	Drug susceptibility test results  

The following list includes all the data required for the index case and is taken from our study materials and the images are screenshots of all the variables you need to include.  


●	MDR tuberculosis notification date  
●	Index case identification code    
●	Total number of contacts in the household    
●	Date of birth  
●	Age  
●	Sex  
●	Address  
●	Contact's telephone number  
●	District of residence  
●	MDR Treatment start date  
●	Sputum test result and date of result   
●	Degree of sputum smear positivity  
●	TB culture result  
●	Xpert result  
●	Drug resistance  
●	Chest radiograph changes  
●	Social risk factors   
●	Previous Treatment courses  
  
To enter one of the four forms, select the plus sign on the right-hand side of the timeline data entry section, select the form you want to load into the timeline, then ensure the box in the timeline is selected (turns yellow) so you can answer the questions within this section.   
  
  
First complete the baseline data entry form. When you select the box, the following screen appears:    
  

<img style="float: centre;" src="img/timelinedataentry.jpeg">     

<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  


	Please answer all questions. You will not be able to progress to the next step unless you do so

	Once all sections are complete, select "complete"

	This generates a TB case surveillance report    

<br/><br/>  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/tb_case_report.jpeg"> 

A box will appear asking if the form is complete. Choose complete and close  
 
The sections on laboratory data, treatment outcome, and drug sensitivity testing can be completed at a later date. None of these are mandatory.  
  
The following screen will appear with the newly entered patient in the list:  
<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/ic_list.jpeg">  
  
<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  


To add the remaining forms (Laboratory forms, treatment and DST) to this index select your patient.  
Repeat the process of adding forms within the "timeline data entry" by selecting the plus sign "+".  

This screen will appear.  
Here you will be able to add lab, treatment, and DST forms  

<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>

#### Treatment forms:
<img style="float: right;" src="img/treatment_form.jpeg">   

<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  
<br/><br/>  
    
You can return to this and add forms later, once results are available  

  
    
      
      
### Contact case registration

Once you have registered an index patient, return to the previous screen by selecting the back button at the top left of the screen.  
You can now register the first contact for this index.  

* Ensure you are in the correct local borough from the list on the left  
* Select the Contact tracing Programme from the drop-down list as shown here  
* Select register  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/contact_reg.jpeg">  

Complete this registration form, the form will only save once complete.  
The contact participant's study ID will auto-generate.  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/contact_enroll.jpeg">  

Information that needs to be entered:  
  
●	Patient's last name  
●	Patient's first name  
●	Date of birth (Age)

Select save  
  
The contacts home page will open with a timeline for follow up  
  
<img style="float: right;" src="img/contact_home_page.jpeg">  

On the home screen you will see:  

●	program registration details  
●	the contact profile  
●	their relationships with other participants  
●	the indicators their data will populate for display on dashboards   
●	their data entry forms in a timeline  

  
### Timeline Data entry  

Within the timeline data entry, you should see the data capture forms for each time point Month 0 (M0), Month 3 (M3), Month 6 (M6), Month 12 (M12), Month 18 (M18) , and Month 24 (M24).   
  
If you cannot see them, they need to be added.   
To add a data capture form, select the + button to the right of the timeline data entry box.   
Select “Add New” 
First select screening visit M0  
To add additional timepoint reviews you can select the “additional review” form.  
  
<img style="float: right;" src="img/visits.jpeg">   

A screen opens allowing you to set the "assessment date" and the "organisational unit" (meaning the district in which the participant lives).  
Select next.  
You will need to do this for each data entry form you add.  

### Baseline visit M0  
 
   
Information to be entered:  

●	Are there any known risk factors?   
●	Previous TB treatment  
●	Previous TB preventive treatment  
●	Duration of exposure (to a symptomatic index) in weeks  
●	MDRTB treatment initiation date of the index  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/M0.jpeg">  

Select all radio buttons relevant for the current contact  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/M0_data.jpeg"> 

	Enter the number of weeks of exposure to a symptomatic index   
	
	Enter Sputum samples and Chest X-ray results once available.  
	
Remind your contact that they will be screened for 2 years, give them a guide on TB symptoms and how to seek help, and give them a card with contact information.  
  
When the form is complete, select complete.  

Add forms M3, M6, M12, M18 and M24 to the contact's dashboard. The dates on these forms are automatically filled in, but you can change them to a date you agree with the contact. You can add additional review forms for reviews at other time points, for example a remote review in paediatrics at 9 months.  

### Follow up visits  
  
When you review this contact at the next visit, make sure to return to the same contact to enter the next data capture form (M3, M6 etc). To do this you can find a list of contact participant IDs under the borough within the Contact tracing program. Ensure you know which participant ID is linked to each contact.  
  
Once you have entered the index case and the contact case it is important to link them by entering a “relationship”.  
  

### Adding a relationship  

<img style="float: right;" src="img/relationship.jpeg">
<img style="float: left;" src="img/relationship_add.jpeg">  

Within the relationship box select the "add" button. A window will open showing a box asking you to add a relationship.   
<img style="float: right;" src="img/relationship_add2.jpeg">  

	From the drop-down menu, select the contact index case   
	A new window will open with your contact and the list of index patients already entered in the system  
	
<img style="float: right;" src="img/relationship_add3.jpeg">   

 	Here you can see the details of your contact participant on the left of the screen  
 	On the right you can search for index TB patients using demographic data  
 	Select the index MDRTB patient of your contact participant   
 	
 The following screen will appear. Select "save" if you are happy that this is the correct index patient.  
 
 <img style="float: right;" src="img/relationship_add4.jpeg">  

You should now see a link within the relationship box on the main page of your contacts.  

Once you have completed all the fields, you will find a box at the bottom left of the screen (scroll down) that says "complete" in yellow. Select this option to complete data entry and save the data. If the data is incomplete, you will see a warning message and you will have to go back and complete the empty fields.  
  
Before leaving the contact, make sure you know the date of your next M3 or M6 follow-up and plan with them where and how it will be (by phone/home person/other location).

### Recording of investigations and interventions by visit SOP  

The purpose of the MDRTB contacts registry project is to facilitate capture and follow-up of 
MDR-TB exposed household contacts by clinics. As such the DHIS2 online tool permits
completion of entries at multiple timepoints but does not force any visit frequency.
Similarly, although the table below describes an approach arrived at after a local Delphi
process in north London following a review of the literature, the investigations and
interventions conducted at each timepoint are not proscribed. Rather the DHIS-2 tool
provides a mechanism for recording and reviewing your clinic practice against your intended
local practice.  

Summary of guidance from national and international agencies  

1. Follow-up  

a. Regardless of decisions around preventive therapy there is a coalescence around a recommendation for 24 months of follow-up, at least six-monthly, following a baseline screen  

b. Recommendations for baseline screening generally include clinical review, chest radiography, testing for LTBI, and microbiological sampling if clinically indicated (if contact is symptomatic)  

c. There is no consistent recommendation on the nature of follow-up (symptom screen, clinical examination, chest radiography, sampling)  

2. Preventive therapy  

a. Guidelines that make recommendations for PT only do so for contacts with demonstrated LTBI (positive IGRA or TST) and no evidence of active TB disease  

b. Decisions about PT should be made on a case-by-case basis  

c. WHO recommends PT be considered for high-risk household contacts (children and immunosuppressed adults) based on risk assessment and clinical judgement  

d. Fluoroquinolones are considered an important component of any PT regimen  

e. There is no single recommended PT regimen; most studies report the use of 2-3 agents for 6-12 months  

  
A draft strategy for MDRTB contact management, drawing upon these principles, was circulated amongst adult and paediatric TB physicians, and iterated according to feedback discussions. The tables below outline the consensus view on frequency and nature of review for adults and children exposed to MDRTB within the household, whether the index case has pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. The same approaches might also be considered suitable for close contact exposure with pulmonary MDRTB outside the household.  


<img style="float: left;" src="img/Screening_interventions.jpeg">   	  
  
    
      
        
          
1 “Review” encompasses history taking to detect early active TB disease – when F2F this can also include clinical examination. Remote review will usually be a telephone consultation. Sampling for microbiological testing to be driven by symptoms.  
2 2-3 month visit after baseline assessment for repeat TST and IGRA, only if initial TST is negative  
3 BCG to be given after 2-3 month visit if initial TST and repeat TST and IGRA all negative  
4 same follow-up for immunocompetent and immunosuppressed  
5 repeat IGRA performed at 2-3 months only if baseline negative (to capture late converters)  



## Obtaining Consent MDRTB  

Standard Operating Procedure for obtaining informed consent  

There are two categories of participant – the index case and the household contact (HHC).  

1. Approach the eligible index case participant  
a. in person during a clinic or household visit  
  
  
2. Approach the eligible HHC participant either  
a. in person during a clinic or household visit (with index case), or  
b. by telephone (with the prior permission of the index patient)  
  
  
3. Provide information about the registry project by  
a. verbal explanation, and  
b. supplying the participant information sheet (PIS) in hard and/or soft copy, and  
c. consider sharing the github site link https://github.com/kmgas/MDRTB-contacts-UK
with participants who wish to see all project-related documents  

It is important to ensure that the participant is able to understand the information given.  
  
  
4. Invite participation and obtain written informed consent through signing of two copies
of the project consent form. One copy should be given to the participant (with a PIS) and
the other should be filed in the site project folder.  
  
  
5. Complete the DHIS2 record for the participant only once consent has been obtained  

Definitions  
  
Index case patients may have pulmonary or extra-pulmonary TB and may have multidrugresistant
TB (resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid) or rifampicin mono-resistant or isoniazid
mono-resistant TB.  

Eligible participants  

Index case patients and their household contacts (HHCs) are eligible to participate HHC  
The registry captures detail on time and duration of exposure to the index case for HHCs, so
the sole criteria for eligibility for inclusion in the Registry as a HHC is:  
the person (adult or child) should have lived in the same household as the index patient at
the time of MDR-TB diagnosis or at any time in the preceding two months.
