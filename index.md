To join the study you will need the following

1. Local ethical approval
  * To do this you need to complete:
    * The organisation information document_V1 (OID) IRAS form. You can find this in the folder named HRA approval documents for each site.
    * To complete this you need signatures from
    * A local PI (a lead TB clinician on site)
    * A local point of contact for the LSHTM sponsor. If the NHS site has a Research and Development Office (R&D), Contract Research Organisation (CRO) or Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) it should be a contact at the R&D/CRO/CTU. If these do not exist this can be a study sponsor, study manager, study coordinator or clinical research scientist.
    * Amend the OID to reference your site only

    * Amend the [IRAS schedule of events](/HRA_approval_documents/IRAS_scheduleofevents MDRTBcontactsregistry.xls) to ensure it is site specific. You can find this in the folder named HRA approval documents for each site.
    * Complete a delegation log (after training has been completed)
    * Submit all these forms to your local RDO and make sure you copy us in at David.Moore@lshtm.ac.uk and kate.gaskell@lshtm.ac.uk
2. Ensure you have up to date Good Clinical Practice training. There are a few online refresher training courses, of which you can access one here.
3. Once you have submitted these forms to your R&D and accessed the training documents, we will arrange training to access the contact registry at https://mdrtb-contacts.lshtm.ac.uk/
